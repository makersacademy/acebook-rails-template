# Process for submitting work to this project

* On Trello, pairs should assign themselves to a card in 'To do' and move it across to 'In progress'
* Make a branch and work on that branch
* When the feature is complete and the tests are passing, make a PR and move the ticket to QA
* Pairs must get 4 squirrels before they merge the code - a student can give one squirrel, a coach can give 2 squirrels
* Once code is merged into master, ensure it is deployed correctly to heroku
* Move the ticket into 'Done' only once it is successfully in production
