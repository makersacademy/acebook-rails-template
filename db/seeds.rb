# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# User.create(
#     #this block of code creates a default user so as to add a user_id in the db posts model;
#     #if this is not in place an error would pop up.
#     id: 1
#     username: "Default User",
#     email: "default@example.com",
#     password: "password"
