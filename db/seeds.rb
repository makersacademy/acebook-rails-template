# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
User.create([{ firstname: 'Jenny', lastname: 'Laynon', username: 'jl', email: 'jen@leynon.com', password: 'jenjen' }])
