Team Umberto Jack Asia Katie David - U-Jakd!


# Monday 10th February 2020 (David)

Today we were randomly assigned into the U-Jakd team! We first discussed when we would have stand-ups, retro's and then laid out a plan as to what we would hope to achieve by the time Wednesday mornings Sprint Demo takes place. We first mobbed - creating the github repo, slack channel and trello board. We then installed rails, discussed adding the necessary gems we would likely need, and added the continous integration (settling on using Travis!) Travis intergration was quickly passed, the app was up and running on Herokou, and user stories were created and split up into individual tasks

We will spend the rest of today making sure each team member has the correct and most recent commit of their git, and set out a plan for tomorrows programming.
