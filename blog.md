Team Umberto Jack Asia Katie David - U-Jakd!


# Monday 10th February 2020 (David)

Today we were randomly assigned into the U-Jakd team! We first discussed when we would have stand-ups, retro's and then laid out a plan as to what we would hope to achieve by the time Wednesday mornings Sprint Demo takes place. We first mobbed - creating the github repo, slack channel and trello board. We then installed rails, discussed adding the necessary gems we would likely need, and added the continous integration (settling on using Travis!) Travis intergration proved tricky, we intally linked this to our repo, but then had some continued troubles with adding our herokou credentials. After much googling we found the answer, and have fully set up our CI and testing suite, the app is up and running on Herokou, and user stories were created and split up into individual tasks which the sub teams will tackle tomorrow.

Today was the second day of the project and time to start Rails. We started the day learning about Rails and how to use it, attending the Rails surgery and then spending the rest of the morning working independently. We then separated into a pair and a three and divided the tasks between the us. Umberto and Jack worked on getting the user sign up and login working whilst the rest of us connected the posting to the users. Connecting the two databases proved harder than we thought, but once we generated the foreign key it all worked smoothly.

We are fairly confident going in, we met all our goals and are able to present an MVP.
The meetings go smoothly, our client is happy, and nothing has to be changed to achieve the user stories.
This leaves us with time to implement optional functionality as the GitHub login.
On the technical side, everything was linear, there's a ton of rails documentation and that made our journey really easy.
There's nothing else to do, other than wait for more user stories from our new client Sophie.
