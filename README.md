# AceBook

Welcome to the Acebook project by team JSpesh, members of the March 2018 cohort at Makers Academy in Shoreditch!

This project is an attempt to build a functional (and probably not particularly pretty!) clone of a certain famous social media platform.

We aren't building it with the intention of producing a competitor (please don't sue us!) - we don't have the expertise or the time.

Rather, the aim is to provide goals and structure under which to familiarise ourselves with the Ruby on Rails framework and associated test-driven development tooling, including, but not limited to, Heroku, Rubocop, Rspec, Travis CI & staging (!insert further tooling here!).
