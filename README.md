MVP aims to have basic functionality:

1. Users can make posts
2. Users can see posts
3. Users can edit posts
4. Users can delete posts

Currently 1 and 2 are completed and 3 is in progression. Next step is to have posts that are edited, have their changes implemented.

The app was deployed on the AWS server. http://production.ujbndkqft3.eu-west-2.elasticbeanstalk.com/
